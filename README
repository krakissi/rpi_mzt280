rpi_mzt280
==========

Display driver system for the Tontec 2.8" LCD on Raspberry Pi.

Code based entirely upon the provided display software.

Setup instructions:
	Clone this repository if you haven't already downloaded it:

		git clone http://github.com/krakissi/rpi_mzt280.git

	Build the tool:

		make && sudo make install

	You will need to manually set the framebuffer size for your terminal
	and start mzt280 when you want the display to work. You have your
	choice of either 640x480 downsampled mode, or 320x240 native.

	FOR 320x240 MODE:

	/boot/config.txt - Add/edit these lines:
		framebuffer_width=320
		framebuffer_height=240

	/etc/rc.local - Add this line before "exit 0"
		/usr/bin/mzt280 -2 &


	FOR 640x480 MODE:

	/boot/config.txt - Add/edit these lines:
		framebuffer_width=640
		framebuffer_height=480

	/etc/rc.local - Add this line before "exit 0"
		/usr/bin/mzt280 &
